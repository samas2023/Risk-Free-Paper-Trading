# Risk-Free-Paper-Trading
Academic Project for Application Development 2 Course.
# Description
Based on the survey of Benefits Canada, 78% of participants have faced financial difficulties because of the high inflation (Staff). Among them, 67 % of participants aged 18 to 24 have no saving/retirement plans at all. Even though the banks have offered about 4% GIC rates, in August 2022, the Canadian inflation rate is even higher with a rate of 7% (Government of Canada). This means each year the funds in our accounts are losing their values by 3% with saving plans and 7% with non-saving plans. To prevent this loss, the stock market is a great way to solve this problem; however, the risk may be higher than savings. This has discouraged many people to enter to the stock market. Therefore, our paper trading application, named “Risk-Free Paper Trading”, will be an application which helps users to approach the stock market safely by allowing people to monitor stock prices, create and save accounts with different portfolios, buy and sell stocks virtually, show gains and losses, calculate passive incomes (from dividends) from stocks, and save memo for transactions with purchased reasons.
